[Bash in 100 Seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4EWvMFj37g) ---
A short introduction to what the bash shell is, how it works, and what can you do with it. A good video for new Linux users.

[Linux Crash Course - nano (command-line text editor)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLeATFgGM-A) ---
A crash course for nano, an alternative to vi editor. I personally prefer using nano because the commands in it are simpler than vi, making it easier to use.

[How To Install Ubuntu on Windows 11 (WSL)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjbbl0TTMeo) ---
A tutorial on how to install Ubuntu on Windows 11 using WSL. Probably unrelated to the OS course, since most of the time we're gonna use the VM. But if you're interested to "integrate" a fully functional Linux terminal into your Windows environment without having to install virtual machines, you can follow this tutorial and use WSL. WSLs are lighter.

[A simple Format String exploit example - bin 0x11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WvrSfcdq1I) ---
An example of how improper code development can lead to exploitations and unintended uses. In this video, a C code is vulnerable to a format string exploit, where the attacker is able to use printf() to control the stack and get what the attacker wants.

[First Stack Buffer Overflow to modify Variable - bin 0x0C](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T03idxny9jE) ---
Another example of how careless coding can lead to security bypasses. In this video, a C code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow exploit, where the attacker can overflow the stack with values the attacker inputs, hence allowing unintended uses such as getting the server shell.

[How SSH key Works ?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2SWzw9D4RA) ---
A video explaining how SSH key works. Most people only generate the keys according to the instructions and there are very few people that understands exactly why it works and why it's needed. This video explains it.

[sudo rm -rf /* - What Happens?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sonKLFb_-d0) ---
A video demonstrating the careless(???) use of the `rm -rf` command in Linux, especially in elevated access. Pretty much summarizes why you should never run this command.

[Ranking Linux Distros 2023: Linux Distribution Tier List](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLN3hddLgF4) ---
A subjective tier list of Linux distributions. If you're interested in knowing (or trying out) other Linux distributions than Debian, maybe you'll find this video interesting.

[Arch Linux speedrun - 1:14 (boot%)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8utpbbdj0LQ) ---
Just for fun. A video of someone [speedrunning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedrunning) setting up Arch Linux guest from scratch to booting up.

[Introduction to Pointers in C](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2i0CnUOniA&pp=ygUYdW5kZXJzdGFuZGluZyBjIHBvaW50ZXJz) ---
An introduction for pointers in C language. Good for those trying to understand pointers in C.
