[Bash in 100 Seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4EWvMFj37g) ---
A short introduction to what the bash shell is, how it works, and what can you do with it. A good video for new Linux users.

[Linux Crash Course - nano (command-line text editor)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLeATFgGM-A)
A crash course for nano, an alternative to vi editor. I personally prefer using nano because the commands in it are simpler than vi, making it easier to use.

[How To Install Ubuntu on Windows 11 (WSL)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjbbl0TTMeo)

But if you're interested to "integrate" a fully functional Linux terminal into your Windows environment without having to install virtual machines, you can follow this tutorial and use WSL. WSLs are lighter.
